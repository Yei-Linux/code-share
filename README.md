# 🔐 Code Share CLI

A developer-friendly CLI that turns any project (JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, etc.) into a **single Base64 `.txt` file**, and allows you to restore it later — even upload it to **Google Drive** for secure cloud backups.

> Ideal for quick sharing, backups, archiving, or shipping prototypes without needing Git.

## 🚀 Features

- 📦 **Encode** an entire project (excluding unwanted files) into a zipped Base64 `.txt`.
- 🔁 **Decode** and restore the project exactly as it was.
- ☁️ **Upload to cloud storage**: Google Drive and Dropbox integration.
- 🔍 Respects `.gitignore` or custom rules.
- 🔐 Optional encryption (coming soon).
- 💼 Useful for freelancers, indie devs, and backups without git.
